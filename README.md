This project is very simple, its implementation was very easy once I learned to "learn how to learn", it consists of an html file with a very simple code just laying out eveything.
I then needed to learn css deeply to not just style the website with some colours, but to give it a hooking look for children with the style alongisde the emojis used.
The javascript used was then so simple and short as I just needed small functions to keep the children hooked by pressing on some buttons that can either give them different quotes or a place to write their names
to display an interactive sentence with thier mame included
